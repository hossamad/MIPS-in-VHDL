# MIPS-in-VHDL
Designing a 16-bit Harvard MIPS Microprocessor using VHDL and implementing it as an ASIC, using design compiler and IC compiler programs, and on a PCB using Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA.
You can simply download "Mips.rar" file, open and explore the project using ISE program instead of open each file individually.
